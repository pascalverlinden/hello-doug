# eris services

Example service definition files and their respective `Dockerfile` for the Eris Platform. See [here](https://monax.io/docs/documentation/cli/latest/specifications/services_specification/) for the services specification. 

**Note:** These services and Dockerfiles are optional for the Eris Platform. They are no longer maintained although we'll happily accept pull requests for updates. Required services are now included in the `eris` binary.

# Installing

To import a service, place its definition file at `~/.eris/services/myservice.toml`.
